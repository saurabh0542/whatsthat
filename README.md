# What's That!? v0.7 (chrome-extension)

A brutally honest WhatsApp Web analyzer, because group chats have politics too. It quietly watches reactions and replies, then surfaces the social gravity you feel but can‚Äôt quite prove: favoritism, marginalization, and influence.

## Why
- Uncover who gets boosted, who gets ignored, and who orbits whom.
- Spot toxic loops early. Celebrate healthy dynamics loudly.
- Which members form secret reaction cartels.
- Who‚Äôs the real influencer vs. who just thinks they are.
- And yes, who loves you significantly less than you thought...


## What it shows
- Relationships: who reacts/replies to whom (and how much it skews).
- Influence: per-person scores from volume and consistency.
- Selectivity: who someone concentrates reactions on (focus, lift, bias).
- Temporal patterns: when the room actually listens.

## How to use 
0. Git Clone or Unzip the downloaded repository to a folder.
1. Load the extension (chrome://extensions ‚Üí Load unpacked).
2. Open WhatsApp Web and scroll through chats you care about.

## Notes
- Data lives locally. Nothing leaves your machine.
- WhatsApp Web loads history in chunks; It persist what you‚Äôve seen and can backfill.
- Export/Import available for audits or offline analysis.
- This is a work in progress ‚ö†Ô∏è
- I am looking for folks to contribute to this project üôÇ

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for ruined friendships, exposed cliques, or awkward brunches.
Use responsibly. Or don‚Äôt - honestly, we‚Äôre all curious who the group‚Äôs real favorite is. But seriously...This is a mirror, not a gavel. Use insights to improve conversations - not weaponize them üòò
