# What's That!? v0.7

A brutally honest WhatsApp Web analyzer, because group chats have politics too. It quietly watches reactions and replies, then surfaces the social gravity you feel but can’t quite prove: favoritism, marginalization, and influence.

## Why
- Uncover who gets boosted, who gets ignored, and who orbits whom.
- Spot toxic loops early. Celebrate healthy dynamics loudly.
- Who reacts to whom - and who’s getting ghosted.
- Which members form secret reaction cartels.
- Who’s the real influencer vs. who just thinks they are.
- And yes, who loves you significantly less than you thought...


## What it shows
- Relationships: who reacts/replies to whom (and how much it skews).
- Influence: per-person scores from volume and consistency.
- Selectivity: who someone concentrates reactions on (focus, lift, bias).
- Temporal patterns: when the room actually listens.

## How to use 
1. Load the extension (chrome://extensions → Load unpacked).
2. Open WhatsApp Web and scroll through chats you care about.
3. Open the dashboard. Read the room.

## Notes
- Data lives locally. Nothing leaves your machine.
- WhatsApp Web loads history in chunks; It persist what you’ve seen and can backfill.
- Export/Import available for audits or offline analysis.
- This is a work in progress ⚠️

## Disclaimer
I am not not responsible for ruined friendships, exposed cliques, or awkward brunches.
Use responsibly. Or don’t - honestly, we’re all curious who the group’s real favorite is. But seriously...This is a mirror, not a gavel. Use insights to improve conversations - not weaponize them 😘
